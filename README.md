A knew a lot about git branching and so much about working with remote repo.

A worked with linux before, but from this course I learned a lot about basic commands and working with groups and
permissions. Piping is a such cool thing too. 

HTTP protocol is to complicated for me for now, because I do not know how exactly I will be use it in future.
So for now it is some magic stuff. I will return to this material later and finished my conspect for part 2.

Git is strongly powerful tool. I exiting with issue tracker and how it fused with commits functionality.
