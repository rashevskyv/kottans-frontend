## Stage 0

### [Git Intro](https://kottans.org/frontend/tasks/git-intro.html)

[First Steps with Git conspect](lessons/st0ls1_Git.md)

A knew alot about git branching and so much about working with remote repo. 

### [Linux CLI, and HTTP](https://kottans.org/frontend/tasks/linux-cli-http.html)

[First Steps with Git conspect](lessons/st0ls2_Linux.md)

![finished Linux Survival course](images/task_linux_cli)

A worked with linux before, buit from this course I learn alot about basic commands and working with groups and
premmissions. Piping is a such cool thing too. 

HTTP protocol is to complicated for me for now, becouse I do not know how ecaxtly I will be use it in future.
So for now it is some magic stuff. I will return to this material later and finished my conspect for part 2.
